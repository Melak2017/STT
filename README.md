# African language Speech Recognition - Speech-to-Text 
![AfricanLanguage](./Images/AfricanLangage.png)

   This project demonstartes how to build speech-to-text deep learning model that process and convert African language((Amharic/Swahili) in to text.
## Introduction
The World Food Program wants to deploy an intelligent form that collects nutritional information of food bought and sold at markets in two different countries in Africa - Ethiopia and Kenya. The design of this intelligent form requires selected people to install an app on their mobile phone, and whenever they buy food, they use their voice to activate the app to register the list of items they just bought in their own language. The intelligent systems in the app are expected to live to transcribe the speech-to-text and organize the information in an easy-to-process way in a database.

Here we will build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing a speech to text in the Amharic language. The model we produce will be accurate and is robust against background noise.

## Objective 

To build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing a speech to text. 


## Data & Features
Dataset for:
    [Amharic](https://github.com/getalp/ALFFA_PUBLIC)
    [Swahili](https://github.com/getalp/ALFFA_PUBLIC)
      
Input features (X): audio clips of spoken words
Target labels (y): a text transcript of what was spoken
