![AfricanLanguage](./Images/AfricanLangage.png)

   This project demonstartes how to build speech-to-text deep learning model that process and convert African language((Amharic/Swahili) in to text.
 

## Objective 

to build a deep learning model that is capable of transcribing a speech to text. 


## Data & Features
Dataset for:
    [Amharic](https://github.com/getalp/ALFFA_PUBLIC)
    [Swahili](https://github.com/getalp/ALFFA_PUBLIC)
